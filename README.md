## todo
- transformer - done
- selection - done
- export as waapi - done
- text
- share (export as brotli'd base64'd state in url) - done
- undo / redo
- shortcuts

## notes
- turned out you can't attach multiple tween objects to the same node which changes everything so now i'm going to go into a different direction: instead of trying to prevent rerendering of entities i'll make them controlled, surely just for timeline seeking purposes this should be ok
